# Emotion Detection Model

## 1. Overview
This project aims to create a real-time emotion detection system using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to recognize seven different emotions: **Angry**, **Disgust**, **Fear**, **Happy**, **Neutral**, **Sad**, and **Surprise**. The system captures video from a webcam, processes the frames, and identifies the emotion displayed by the person in the frame.

## 2. Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files and directories:

- **emotiondetector.json**: Contains the model architecture in JSON format.
- **emotiondetector.h5**: Contains the pre-trained model weights.
- **model_training.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook used for training the emotion detection model.
- **realtime.py**: Python script that implements real-time emotion detection using the webcam.
- **README.md**: Provides a high-level overview and instructions for the project.
- **requirement.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## 3. Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for training and deploying models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt

4. Model Training
The model training process is detailed in the model_training.ipynb notebook. This section explains the steps involved in creating the emotion detection model.

4.1 Data Preparation
The dataset used for training consists of images categorized into seven emotion labels. Each image is converted to grayscale and resized to 48x48 pixels to reduce the computational load. The labels are one-hot encoded, which allows the model to predict a probability distribution over the seven classes.

4.2 Model Architecture
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that includes the following layers:

Input Layer: Takes in images of size 48x48x1 (grayscale).
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the images using filters.
MaxPooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly setting some activations to zero.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D feature vector.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers that perform the classification.
Output Layer: A softmax layer that outputs the probability of each emotion.
4.3 Training Process
The model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The model is evaluated on a separate test set to monitor its performance. The training process involves the following steps:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Define the CNN architecture.
Compile the model with the appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train the model on the training data while validating it on the test data.
Save the trained model in the emotiondetector.json and emotiondetector.h5 files.
5. Real-time Emotion Detection
The realtime.py script implements the real-time emotion detection functionality. This script uses OpenCV to capture video frames from a webcam and the pre-trained CNN model to predict emotions.

5.1 Face Detection
The script uses the Haar Cascade classifier provided by OpenCV to detect faces in the video frames. The detected faces are then cropped and resized to 48x48 pixels before being fed into the model for emotion prediction.

5.2 Emotion Prediction
For each detected face, the model predicts the emotion by passing the preprocessed image through the network. The predicted emotion is displayed on the video feed using OpenCV.

5.3 Running the Script
To run the real-time emotion detection, execute the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python realtime.py
The webcam will start, and the emotion detected for each face will be displayed in real-time on the video feed.

5.4 Handling Errors
The script includes error handling for cases where OpenCV fails to process the frame correctly, ensuring that the program continues to run smoothly even if a frame is skipped.

6. Results
The model is capable of accurately detecting and displaying emotions in real-time. Below is an example of the output:


6.1 Model Performance
The model has shown high accuracy on the test set, making it suitable for real-time applications. However, its performance may vary depending on lighting conditions and the quality of the webcam.

6.2 Example Outputs
Include screenshots or GIFs that demonstrate the system detecting different emotions in real-time.

7. Future Work
While the current implementation is functional, there are several areas for improvement:

Model Optimization: Explore different neural network architectures to improve accuracy and speed.
Dataset Expansion: Use a more diverse dataset with varied facial expressions and lighting conditions.
Cross-platform Deployment: Implement the system as a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.
Emotion Analysis: Extend the project to analyze emotion trends over time or in specific contexts (e.g., analyzing customer emotions in a retail environment).
